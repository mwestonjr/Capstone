# Capstone - Analysis of Economic Factors Tied to Housing

Motivation:

I have an interest in the stock market and economy. Part of that is an interest in the housing market. I have noticed a drastic increase in home values over the past three or four years. I often wonder how people afford homes. I wanted to dig into the data and see how home values impact parts of the economy and how economic factors impact home values.
 
Data Questions:

* Is there a correlation between home values and inflation?
* How do rates impact home values?
* Is consumer confidence impacted by increasing home values?
* How have home values grown compared to wages? How has the disparity increased over the past 40 years?
* How have home values increased compared to stock values. Have homes become a better investment than stocks?
* How have home values in Nashville grown compared to consumer pricing and the United States?


Technologies:

* Python -(Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, and Numpy Finance
* Microsoft PowerBI
* Microsoft Excel

Process:

* Gathered data from source websites.
* Cleaned data using Excel and Python.
* Convert cleaned data from Python and upload it to my data folder as a CSV.
* Loaded the CSVs to PowerBI to create my presentation.

Challenges:

There was a lot of data to go through and clean. Some of data was challenging to clean in Python. I pulled data from various sources that ended up not being used.

Conclusion:


There is a strong correlation between consumer pricing and homes values. There is is a negative correlation between homes values and the 30-year fixed. It appears that when rates are high, home values tend to stay flat. But when rates are low, home values increase. There is a small correlation between consumer sentiment and homes values. Based on the chart, it appears that there isn�t much correlation until 2011 when consumer sentiment and home prices seemed to increase together till 2019. Since 2019, home prices have continued increasing, but consumer sentiment has been in a steady decline. Percent of income was highest in the early 80�s where it was almost 80%. It has trending downward till 2020, where it's increased drastically. The housing market and the S&P 500 grew almost at the same rate from 2019 to 2021, but the housing market has steadily declined since 2021. The Nashville market has grown drastically over the past 5 years, but less than the average since 2000.
